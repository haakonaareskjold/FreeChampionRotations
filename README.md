## Important changes - 31/03/2020
- Riot changed how ARAM rotations works as of 31/03/2020, check the "new" branch to see what's on
the live site, legacy code(master branch) is still available, [Click here](https://plebs.website)
to see it.
- major difference between OLD and NEW is that now it displays 65 champions that are always available in ARAM,
plus the weekly rotation from before. Which makes the previous two rotations that are cached obsolete.
